Solar Panels Dataset:

Multi-resolution dataset for photovoltaic panel segmentation from satellite and aerial imagery (https://zenodo.org/record/5171712)

Also available at kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salimhammadi07/solar-panel-detection-and-identification

I've used Data.py in order to download and split the dataset into 3 categories(train, test, val) + resize to (256,256) + turn into .png files.
